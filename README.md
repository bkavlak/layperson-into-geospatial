# Layperson Walk into the Free and Open Geospatial Clergy

The last year of my university years was a horrible time. You need money; you studied business; you actually wanted to be an actor, why did you study business; you still have some dignity salted with ego so that you don't wanna get melted into a corporate; you think maybe academia is the way; you think who is gonna afford another investment for studying something nobody cares anymore and there are already millions "copy" of you out there; you search for something meaningful in life for yourself although you know very little about yourself; you really need money.

Amidst this chaotic early youth mantra, I find myself in an agri-tech startup in İstanbul where I can at least afford to live. After my first dearest task of researching marijuana legalization, somehow, I ended up researching how to classify satellite imagery to detect tomato fields. An economist guy from my university, Sinan, showed me how he visualizes an NDVI band literally in Excel by adjusting cells and giving them numbers and colors accordingly. Luckily, we got Betül doing her masters in geomatics at that time, and she said: "Look kids..." while we were looking with an empty face and started to explain the business here.

After getting the basics from Betül, I did what I've been doing since I was 7 years old: I started to surf the internet alone. My walk started into this clergy of people sharing everything they know with me. Contacted many people on Linkedin, watched Youtube videos, read blogs, never understood PyQGIS, hired by a guy among those people and moved to Berlin, where I started acting after years, attended FOSS4Gs, saw many in-person that I was stalking online, met randomly with people from Yer Çizenler & HOT during a disaster relief, felt some meaning, felt in my nerves deeply that I'm not alone in this shapeless Earth, at least not always.

This is the space for the talk **“A Layperson Walks into Open Geospatial Clergy”** at Mostar, FOSS4GE 2025. The recording will hopefully be available here. If you're new to free and open geospatial data, this information may be useful to you. If not, you’re welcome to ask questions or randomly complain in issues or discussions. Talk not only to AI, but also to your Self — just start somewhere.

## What is this mystical free and open geospatial clergy?

When the wind blows directly on your face or a whistle tickles your ears, do you know what just happened? The Earth rotates on its axis, and things shine as it turns. The leaves might have some idea, or maybe the clouds could lend you a soft mattress to tell the myths of the universe. Some people share stories and tricks; others listen or add to them. Many never even hear these stories, but some won’t stop telling them.

Free and Open Geospatial Clergy might be another story about things happening — maybe true, maybe not. The clergy have helped me greatly during my self-learning process, and they continue to do so. I wanted to collect some materials along the way that helped me, and maybe will help you as well. I forgot to stress the word "Free" in the talk; looking back, it is a significant difference and should have been "Layperson walk into Free and Open Geospatial Clergy". Anyways, we live between the lines of the regrets and actualizations, ignorance and wisdom, so on and so forth. The talk was also just a talk. As I tried to stress in the talk, I'm an average person.

People in the clergy, while being open, also helped me to be free. Free from the reality forcibly constructed around me. Since my childhood, whenever I got stuck in this life questioning myself, my thoughts, my being, my worth, and all other depressive stuff, I scrolled back to the internet and found people like me. At the time of my youth mantra of destructive thoughts, when I was struggling to find my way in this career hell (which I still struggle with), I connected to these people's materials and found many ways of living. Also, during my career hell, they keep showing up. They are really interesting people.

## Who are these free people?

It’s best to ask them yourself. In my experience, they’re good people, though “good” is a topic for a long discussion. They’re passionate about what they do, often without knowing why. They have ideas and questions and keep searching until they burn out. They hold strong opinions about how people should organize, behave, and work, and often disagree with one another. They discuss, and sometimes they even decide things.

As far as I can tell, they’re human. It’s not just the mystical geospatial, but exploring [Free Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) can help you understand a bit spirit here. Freedom itself is a long story — for that, maybe check the history of politics, science, and for sure, philosophy. Also, psychology, mythology, anthropology, and, I don't know, economics? There was one more thing. It is a huge topic; I still think about it sometimes, randomly, in the toilet or during the shower. Ahh, and of course, geography.

## Where to start?

If you are like I used to be, quite blank around here, and acknowledging that, it may be good to check some fundamentals from courses. Combining them with some practices, like solving a problem or a case, helped me. However, this is pretty generic advice that you can get everywhere. You may also need motivation to build, which can be really hard. What actually motivated me at that time is a mystery to me. I believe it is more than just working on something; it's about internalizing and becoming what you do. It is a different kind of living experience.

I'm still searching for answers to understand why I do certain things. I'm not sure if these questions can be answered by the same person who is performing the action. When I analyzed myself, I observed that the main motivation that carried me to build a character around certain things was geospatial at some point in my life. So, related to our topic, I mostly searched to become one of the mellow people out there sharing stuff for free and freely. So, I started just by imitating.

## You Probably Don't Know

You probably don't know what a coordinate really means in this context. I assume you are familiar with Descartes' innovation of Cartesian coordinates and some geometric stuff. It is not very different here, but a bit different. You need to become familiar with concepts such as *Coordinate Reference Systems*, *Map Projections*, *Vector Data*, *Raster Data*, *Affine Transformation*, and the basics of *what GPS is*. It is not rocket science; just prioritize learning these fundamental concepts, which can be found in courses and many YouTube videos, such as [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3tdW9l1690&t=652s&ab_channel=Numberphile).

For about 6 months, I thought production code was something related to the factory as I studied business and some operational domains. You probably don't know many concepts and words, or at worst, that you even misinterpret them. It is really wise to check a word, providing the context you are using, such as GIS, to make your life easier in the research or learning process. Knowing that you don't know is the cure, as Socrates taught, as Plato reported. It is really useful.


## Material Dump

You might find these useful to explore. You can also point them to GPT models — they might uncover something better with these. Monks suggest asking for references for everything you hear in this life. After that, it's up to luck or agency to utilize the information.

Contemplate these counsels — maybe while you're in the toilet.
