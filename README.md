# Layperson introduction to geospatial
*I'll be close to the finish at some point in life, bear with me.*

Welcome to embrace the chaos. This is the space for the talk "Layperson walk into open geospatial clergy" at Mostar, FOSS4GE 2025. The recording will be here hopefully. If you are new to geospatial, you can find here useful. Talk not only to AI but also with yourself and start somewhere.

## What is this mystical geospatial?
I'm lazy to explain this now, will add.

## Who are these people?
I'm lazy to explain this now, will add.

## What are these organizations?
I'm lazy to explain this now, will add.

- [Open Geospatial Foundation](https://www.osgeo.org/) - The organization. Many projects are organized under OsGeo.
- [OpenStreetMap Foundation](https://osmfoundation.org/) - You'll probably think there should exist something on the map, and it's already there in OSM.
- [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team](https://www.hotosm.org/) - A separate organization focus on humanitarian issues.
- [Open Geo Hub](https://opengeohub.org/) - Very nice summer school programs which are also uploaded freely.
