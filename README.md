# Layperson Walk into the Free and Open Geospatial Clergy <img src='logo-with-chatgpt.png' align="right" height="240" /></a>

The last year of my university years was a horrible time. You need money; you studied business; you actually wanted to be an actor, why did you study business; you still have some dignity salted with ego so that you don't wanna get melted into a corporate; you think maybe academia is the way; you think who is gonna afford another investment for studying something nobody cares anymore and there are already millions "copy" of you out there; you search for something meaningful in life for yourself although you know very little about yourself; you really need money.

Amidst this chaotic early youth mantra, I found myself in an agri-tech startup in İstanbul where I could at least afford to live. After my first dearest task of researching marijuana legalization, somehow, I ended up researching how to classify satellite imagery to detect tomato fields. An economist guy from my university, Sinan, showed me how he visualizes an NDVI band literally in Excel by adjusting cells and giving them numbers and colors accordingly. Luckily, we got Betül doing her masters in geomatics at that time, and she said: "Look kids..." while we were looking with an empty face and started to explain the business here.

After getting the basics from Betül, I did what I've been doing since I was 7 years old: I started to surf the internet alone. My walk started into this clergy of people sharing everything they know with me. Contacted many people on Linkedin, watched Youtube videos, read blogs, never understood PyQGIS, hired by a guy among those people and moved to Berlin, where I started acting after years, attended FOSS4Gs, saw many in-person that I was stalking online, met randomly with people from Yer Çizenler & HOT during a disaster relief, felt some meaning, felt in my nerves deeply that I'm not alone in this shapeless Earth, at least not always.

This is the space for the talk **“A Layperson Walks into Open Geospatial Clergy”** at Mostar, FOSS4GE 2025. The recording will hopefully be available here. If you're new to free and open geospatial data, this information may be useful to you. If not, you’re welcome to ask questions or randomly complain in issues or discussions. Talk not only to AI, but also to your Self — just start somewhere. [The limited guide](#the-limited-guide-to-the-galaxy) might be a helpful resource for you.

## What is this mystical free and open geospatial clergy?

When the wind blows directly on your face or a whistle tickles your ears, do you know what just happened? The Earth rotates on its axis, and things shine as it turns. The leaves might have some idea, or the clouds might lend you a soft mattress to tell the myths of the universe. Some people share stories and tricks; others listen or add to them. Many never even hear these stories, but some won’t stop telling them.

Free and Open Geospatial Clergy might be another story about things happening — maybe true, maybe not. The clergy have helped me immensely during my self-learning process, and they continue to do so. I wanted to collect some materials along the way that helped me, and maybe will help you as well. I forgot to stress the word "Free" in the talk; looking back, it is a significant difference and should have been "Layperson walk into Free and Open Geospatial Clergy". Anyway, we live between the lines of regrets and actualizations, ignorance and wisdom, and so on. The talk was also just a talk. As I tried to stress in the talk, I'm an average person.

People in the clergy, while being open, also helped me to be free. Free from the reality forcibly constructed around me. Since my childhood, whenever I got stuck in this life questioning myself, my thoughts, my being, my worth, and all other depressive stuff, I scrolled back to the internet and found people like me. I've been scrolling through internet subcultures: forums, underground rap recordings, collaborative hypertext dictionaries specific to Türkiye such as [inci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%B0nci_S%C3%B6zl%C3%BCk) or [eksi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ek%C5%9Fi_S%C3%B6zl%C3%BCk), and of course, later Twitter and Youtube when they were not filled with bullshits. 

At the time of my youth mantra of destructive thoughts and worries, when I was struggling to find my way in this career hell after graduation (which I still struggle with), I connected with these people's materials and discovered many different ways of living. Also, during my career hell, they keep showing up. They are really interesting people.

## Who are these people?

It’s best to ask them yourself. In my experience, they’re good people, though “good” is a topic for a lengthy discussion. They’re passionate about what they do, often without knowing why. They have ideas and questions and keep searching until they burn out. They hold strong opinions about how people should organize, behave, and work, and often disagree with one another. They discuss, and sometimes they even decide things.

As far as I can tell, they’re human. Not only the mystical geospatial, but exploring movements like [Free Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software), [How Python became the language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfH4QL4VqJ0), and actually the [Internet History](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47NRaBVxgVM&t=36s) can help you understand a bit of the spirit here. I feel the spirit is around the Freedom, and it is a long story — for that, maybe check the history of politics, science, and, for sure, philosophy. Also, as lately refined: psychology, mythology, anthropology, sociology, and, I don't know, economics? There was one more thing. It is a vast topic; I think about it sometimes, randomly, in the toilet or during the shower. Ah, and of course, to understand the geospatial people, geography is a nice domain.

## Where to start?

If you are like I used to be, quite blank around here, and acknowledging that, it may be good to check some fundamentals from courses. Combining them with some practices, such as solving a problem or a case, or working on a project, helped me. Whenever I do something, I try to make it a little bit better than what I did before, and if I'm motivated, I even iterate over what I did and redo it. However, this is pretty generic advice, and you simply need a motivation to do it. You need to build and keep the motivation to learn, which is really hard in this mad world. What motivated me at that time is a mystery to me. I believe it is more than just working on something; it's about internalizing and becoming what you do. It is a different kind of living experience.

I'm still searching for answers to understand why I do certain things. I'm not sure if these questions can be answered by the same person who is asking. Mentioned in the talk, I wanted to be an actor, but I couldn't make it a professional life. Consciously, I kept pushing the idea of building a character for my low-budget acting self-learning process while I worked in different jobs, and the "geospatial persona" was the role at that point in my life. I mostly searched to become one of the mellow people out there, sharing stuff for free and freely. So, I started just by imitating and acting. I don't think I did a lot compared to these real mellow people, and I'm just being honest here, not in an imposter syndrome. Even doing some helped me progress quite a lot here and kept me in the [flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)).

When we talk about learning, we are primarily referring to reaching a point where we have acquired the knowledge we were trying to learn. If we wanna solve the learning puzzle with questions: "How to learn?", "Where to start learning?", "What to learn?". Pondering on the question of "What is knowledge?" is interestingly useful. Addressing questions like "What type of knowledge am I trying to get here?" was helpful to me. I found that the cognitive science community has nice answers, such as [Four Kinds of Knowing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrW3DOIkP78&ab_channel=JohnVervaeke). [Awakening from the Meaning Crisis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncd6q9uIEdw&list=PLND1JCRq8Vuh3f0P5qjrSdb5eC1ZfZwWJ&index=1&ab_channel=JohnVervaeke) is a nice resource that helped me during those times to realize certain things about myself and my motivation. I don't know how much it would relate to you at this time, as it doesn't have the same effect on everybody. You need to be in a specific type of mentality to absorb the information thoroughly.

I have always followed the general advice from thousands of years: never assume that you have finished something in life.

## You Probably Don't Know

If you are not familiar with computer science basics, you may misunderstand many concepts. For about 6 months, I thought production code was something related to the factory as I studied business and some operational domains. You probably don't know many concepts and words, or at worst, you even misinterpret them. It is really wise to check a word, providing the context you are using, such as GIS or geospatial, to make your research or learning process easier. Knowing that you don't know is the cure, as Socrates taught, as Plato reported. Materials with fundamentals helped me to understand what these people are referring to, both for computer science and geospatial topics.

You probably don't know what a coordinate really means in this context. I assume you are familiar with Descartes' innovation of Cartesian coordinates and some geometric stuff. It is not very different here, but a bit different. You need to become familiar with concepts such as *Coordinate Reference Systems*, *Map Projections*, *Vector Data*, *Raster Data*, *Affine Transformation*, and the basics of *what GPS is*. It is not rocket science; just prioritize learning these fundamental concepts, which can be found in courses and many fun YouTube videos, such as [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3tdW9l1690&t=652s&ab_channel=Numberphile).

I probably don't know what you probably don't know. Please tell if you know what you don't know in [discussions](https://github.com/bkavlak/layperson-into-geospatial/discussions) so that we can add up here.

You might find these useful to explore. You can also point them to GPT models — they might uncover something better with these. Monks suggest asking for references for everything you hear in this life. After that, it's up to luck or agency to utilize the information.

This information is pretty dispersed on the web sources like Wikipedia, Osgeo Wiki, Grass Wiki, Linkedin posts, used to be around Twitter, and now around Mastodon, conference talks, random GitHub repositories, in the minds of different people. I'm parsing it manually as I find it helpful and putting it here.

Contemplate these counsels — maybe while you're in the toilet.
