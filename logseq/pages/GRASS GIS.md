  (GIS) software suite used for geospatial data management and analysis, 
  image processing, producing graphics and maps, spatial and temporal 
  modeling, and visualizing. It can handle [raster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics), [topological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological) [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(geometric)), [image processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_processing), and [graphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics) data.
- GRASS contains over 350 modules to render maps and images on 
  monitor and paper; manipulate [[raster]] and [[vector]] data including vector 
  networks; process multispectral image data; and create, manage, and
