- More decent information is [GRASS GIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRASS_GIS)
- Abbrevation for Geographic Resources Analysis Support System. It is one of the early GIS software around and quite powerful. You may find it hard to onboard yourself as it is a bit challenging at start. If you deal with large data sets on your local computer, it is quite useful. For [[production]]-like usage, you can struggle. Companies such as [Mundialis](https://www.mundialis.de/en/) provides trainings and consultancy on that if you are highly interested in this software.
- GRASS contains many modules to render maps and images on  monitor and paper; manipulate [[raster]] and [[vector]] data including vector networks; process multispectral image data; and create, manage, and store spatial data. It has APIs for [[python]] so that you can write scripts but it is not very straightforward.
- Some Interesting Facts (at least to me):
	- [[FOSS4G]] used to be a GRASS GIS conference.
