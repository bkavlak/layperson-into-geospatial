- The **Geospatial Data Abstraction [[Library]]** (**GDAL**) is a computer software [library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computer_science)) for reading and writing [[raster]]
	- and [[vector]] [geospatial data formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIS_file_formats) (e.g. [shapefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile)), and is released under the [permissive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissive_free_software_licence) [X/MIT style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License) free software license by the [Open Source Geospatial Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source_Geospatial_Foundation). As a library, it presents a single [abstract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_(computer_science)) [data model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_model) to the calling application for all supported formats. It may also be built with a variety of useful [command line interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_line_interface) [utilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_program) for data translation and processing. Projections and transformations are supported by the [PROJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PROJ) library.
